Reflections:
This is the Odin Project's Rock, Paper, Scissors project.  This is the first project in the JavaScript section of Fundamentals.  It was nice to finally build something after all of the learning and reading from the past week.  I didn't retain quite as much as I hoped, but I was still able to put this together in a few hours.  I've realized that there are a lot of different ways to build a simple project like this.

I know one day I will look back on this code and think it's crap, but for now I'm very pleased with it.  Overall I was never as lost as I feared I might be for my first JS project.
